# pusher-js-examples

Check out demo: https://ilmlv.github.io/pusher-js-toolkit/

## Quick setup
For development use cases propably can use github pages hosted version, but if authoization API is protected by CORS, than you need to self host this tool or proxy authorization API.

### Starting own http server
```
cd pusher-js-toolkit
npm install http-server -g
http-server
```
